## Overview 
ATmega168 micro controller based implementation of the classic tic tac toe (naught's and crosses) game. The game display is via a LCD screen which implements the hd44780 standard (using my https://github.com/darkosancanin/hd44780_lcd library) with 4 directional buttons and a select button as inputs.

This project was done very early on as a way of learning more about AVR micro controllers.
